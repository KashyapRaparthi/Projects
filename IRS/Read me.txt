Welcome to IRS simulator

Stage-1: Single IRS Component between Tx & Rx
Stage-2: Multiple IRS Components between Tx & Rx
Stage-3: Tx & Rx between two sided wall.Each wall has Multiple IRS Components between Tx & Rx

Requirements:
1.Python 3 

Inputs:

[1]: Select the Stage you want to simulate

[2]: Enter different Values required (Lambda,H_t,H_r,frequency etc)
     Enter only in float or integers.no units are required.Every paramter is considered in it's SI unit. 	

Outputs:

[1]: Attenuation Factor & Phase of received signal calculated Analytically and that from Derived formula

[2]: If stage-1 is simulated then Attenuation v/s Reflection Coeff Phase is plotted with step of 10 degree.
